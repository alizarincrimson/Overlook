-------------------------------------------

Add your image files in the `src/images` directory. Similar to CSS files, you need to `import` image files in the JavaScript entry file (`index.js`). Then go into the HTML and add an `img` element with the `src` attribute pointing to the `images` directory. There is an example in the `index.html` file for you to see.

## How to View the App Locally

In your terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view the code running in the browser.

## Test Files Organization

Similar to feature code, your test code needs to be put in a specific place for it to run successfully.

**Put all of your test files in the `test` directory.** As a convention, all test filenames should end with `-test.js`. For

## Linting Your Code

Run the command in your terminal `npm run lint` to run the linter on your JavaScript code. There will be errors and warnings right from the start in this starter kit - the linter is still running successfully.

Your linter will look at the JavaScript files you have within the `src` directory and the `test` directory.
